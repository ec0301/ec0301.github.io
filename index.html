	Welcome to my first web page.
	Just testing out a few things from what I just learned about creating a basic webpage from scratch.
	
	On the next line I am going to input a link to a webpage and see if it populates.

	No it does not work. There must be another way other then the basic way that I put this in.
	Honestly this is just putting this in as plain text in a single line. 
	Later we will learn how to embed a link into a page.
